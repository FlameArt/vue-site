## Usage

This is a project template for old version [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).
Even if you have version 3 of vue-cli, you can install `@vue/cli-init`

And use it as you used before.

``` bash
$ npm i -g @vue/cli
$ npm i -g @vue/cli-init
$ vue init xrei/vue-ssr project-name
$ cd project-name
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 7070 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `.env`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.

### TODO
